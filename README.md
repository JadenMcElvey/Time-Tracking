# Time-Tracking
## Overview
A repository to track how I use my time. Data will be recorded in text files. Data will be analyzed via Tableau.

## Organization
Within the time tracking text file data is recorded in the format `Major,Minor,Specific,Time`. Time will not only be recorded per specific activity but each activity will be assigned a major and minor grouping. These groups are intended to help in data analysis. The groups are explained below.

####Major Groups:

* EU(**E**ssential **U**tility)
* NU(**N**on-Essential **U**tility)
* EL(**E**ssential **L**acks Utility)
* NL(**N**on-Essential **L**acks Utility)
* LE(**L**ife **E**ssential)

Major Groups group actions in a utilitarian way. Each group is listed above first with the abreviation used to refer to it in text files and then followed with its meaning written in parenthesis. Major Groups are essentially a measure of how my time is spent compared to the _utility_. Here _utility_ is defined as contributing to people's well being(mostly my own). The first grouping Essential _Utility_ is intended to contain all actions that I must complete and do provide  utlity. The grouping Non-Essential _Utility_ is intended for actions that I take part in of my own volition that provide utlity. Actions that I must complete but do not provide _utility_ fall under Essential Lacks _Utility_. Actions completed of my own volition that do not provide _utility_(essentially wastes of time) fall under Non-Essential Lacks _Utility_. Lastly the Life Essential group is for general actions I must keep to stay alive(sleep,eat,etc.). These groups are the most important as they provide true insight into the quality of life. For instance a truly minimal life would only include the essential categories and a wasteful life would include the essential but would have a large proportion of time spent on actions lacking _utility_. The idea is to maximise time spent on increasing _utility_, decreasing time spent without _utility_, and making life essentials as efficiently spent as possible.

####Minor Groups:
* Living
* Lazy
* Meta
* Project
* Recreation
* School
* Work

Minor categories provide less insight into how life is being spent and are more for just breaking time into categories. They are cateegories that are more easily understandable and show in what ways my time is spent with a limited number of categories. Most minor groups have self-explanetory names. The meta group is for tracking time spent tracking time.
The specific category in the text files is for denoting the specific action that the row represents and the time category is for recording the time spent per action in seconds.
